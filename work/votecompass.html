          Vote Compass is an interactive electoral literacy application developed by political scientists and run during election campaigns. It offers an accessible framework for learning about party apps, stimulates discussion on a wide variety of election issues, and encourages democratic participation within the electorate. Functional Imperative rebuilt Vote Compass’ infrastructure which has registered nearly 5 million full respondents to its polls and has received about 13 million unique visitors.

          Functional Imperative was approached by Vote Compass as the 2013 Australian general election approached. Having partnered with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Vote Compass was poised to receive signi!icant exposure and traffic within the short election cycle window. Previous experience led Vote Compass to believe that their existing infrastructure might not be able to scale for the large loads expected. On a tight deadline, Functional Imperative investigated and recommended changes to the Vote Compass infrastructure to minimize load-time, maximize up-time and ensure an optimal user experience.
