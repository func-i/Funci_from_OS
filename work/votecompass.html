          Vote Compass is an interactive electoral literacy application developed by political scientists and run during election campaigns. It offers an accessible framework for learning about party apps, stimulates discussion on a wide variety of election issues, and encourages democratic participation within the electorate. Functional Imperative rebuilt Vote Compass’ infrastructure which has registered nearly 5 million full respondents to its polls and has received about 13 million unique visitors.

          Minimize loading whilst maximizing up time
        </h2>
        <p>
          Functional Imperative was approached by Vote Compass as the 2013 Australian general election approached. Having partnered with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Vote Compass was poised to receive significant exposure and traffic within the short election cycle window. Previous experience led Vote Compass to believe that their existing infrastructure might not be able to scale for the large loads expected. On a tight deadline, Functional Imperative investigated and recommended changes to the Vote Compass infrastructure to minimize load-time, maximize up-time and ensure an optimal user experience.

          Based on an individual’s responses to a series of propositions specifically developed for a given election, Vote Compass generates a real-time analysis of how one’s views compare to the apps of each political party vying for office. This analysis is powered by an open database which contains a public record of each party’s stand on the issues included in Vote Compass.

          Working quickly, we identified issues with server response and page load times. To mitigate we:
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>Minified static assets</h3>
            <p>Serving images, javascript, css and using a CDN network.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Added a cacheing layer</h3>
            <p>Using multiple MemCache servers.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Added load balancers</h3>
            <p>With automatic server scaling to handle surges in traffic.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Optimized long running queries</h3>
            <p>Which were needlessly locking database rows.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Ran stress tests</h3>
            <p>Ensuring performance under 2x peak load.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          With the changes completed in time, Vote Compass was used by millions of visitors and handled over seven thousand requests per minute at its peak. We are now actively working with Vote Compass as they expand globally.
