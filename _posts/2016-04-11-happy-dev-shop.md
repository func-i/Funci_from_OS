## Building a Better Dev Team

I recently read [this](http://www.onebigfluke.com/2016/04/whats-awful-building-software.html) article which highlighted a number of complaints that many developers will probably have during their career.  As the CTO of my development company, I have been in all three of the roles mentioned in the article.  I related to a lot of the complaints at some point in my career but I don't really feel that they impact me as much anymore.  
It got me thinking if we do something different at [Functional Imperative](http://www.functionalimperative.com).

### What makes a happy developer?

This is a loaded question, but I think a few key aspects can make all the difference

As a developer I would like to:

* __Feel valued__
  * Are the projects I'm working on important and am I making valuable contributions to them?
  * Are my suggestions and opinions being listened to?  (They don't have to be implemented, but it would be nice if they were taken into consideration.  A good idea is always a good idea)
* __Always be learning__
  * A stagnant developer will look for new work in 3-6 months
  * I should be able to stay relevant as well as perfect my existing skill set
* __Have variety__
  * Variety ties in to _Always be Learning_, but variety doesn't just mean technology.  It can mean variety in velocity (crazy times and slower times), areas of the project, team members, etc
  * I can work really hard when I needed, but do I get to slow down in between or am I just a work horse?

Obviously a happy developer works with a team that has practices which promote this wish list, but **how**?

### Feel Valued

I find the best way for a developer to take pride in their work and have a sense of accomplishment is to give them
more responsibility.  At [Functional Imperative](http://www.functionalimperative.com), our developers are often given large portions of a project or entire projects
to be a lead on.  The developer may be a junior and will be closely mentored, but they will immediately receive a large
amount of responsibility.  

This means a developer is responsible for proposing the initial Data Model, rounds of QA,
code quality (code review followed by refactoring) and the automated testing.
They may also communicate with the client (internal or external) directly without a PM in between, deploy to staging
and submitting the pull request.  

_"You can't just give everyone that much responsibility, Juniors write horrible code and it will be terrible!"_

This above model can be applied to any amount of work.  The idea is to stop pigeon holding people, start trusting them
and give them as much as you they show you they feel comfortable handling.

### Always Be Learning (ABL?)

_"There's just too much to learn and not enough time"_

We have an excellent recipe to tackle this one.  As a Dev shop we receive new projects all the time.
We try to employ our own **80 / 20 rule**.

This states that **80%** of a project is something we know and **20%** is something we want to learn.

If you want to tackle something large like using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react), or [Angular 2.0](https://angular.io/) for the first time, see if there is a spot where
you can use it as a widget instead of an entire Single Page Application.

If you want to learn Elixir for the first time, perhaps there is a section of your app you can convert into a 
web service or API that lends itself to functional programming.

The 80% you know could be adding existing functionality to your app to support these new peripherals.


### Have Variety

I'm learning new technologies with the **80 / 20 rule**, so I'm already getting variety.  

This may be a personal thing but I like hitting hardcore deadlines while delivering an excellent product.
Is there any better measure of success for a developer?  While I love this feeling, it can't be my entire life.
I need to balance that with some regular work or community activities (perhaps writing a blog on my down time)

If I worked for a product company, I would like to work on various aspects of the project (not just the HTML/CSS).
Give me some React, some back-end work, let me try optimizing some code, how does the payment processing work, etc.

Not everyone's skill sets can be as varied, but a manager should still be looking for different areas of the project
for each developer to learn.

This is also healthy for the project(s) as the knowledge isn't isolated to a few individuals.

### Other Concerns

Does this only apply to regular developers?  No, I don't think so.  
A senior developer can architect new projects while learning new technologies so 
that juniors can come in on a strong foundation.  They also have to learn the different tools so that they can
code review them.  Stay one step ahead of the junior.

Individual developers have more responsibility which creates a much flatter organization and reduces the need 
for meetings about meetings; Direct communication is a huge time saver.

I don't disagree with the "Gripe List", as I said, I've felt them too.  I think a lot of them are present in any
organization that has too much management and unnecessary red tape.  

Everything I've mentioned works for us because we are a medium sized dev company that takes time to have group code reviews,
lunch and learns, trusts its employees, cares about learning, [funds learning at events](http://devhub.ca), [gets involved in the community](http://lighthouselabs.ca),
and generally tries to put things in place that developers want and we feel need.

I don't see why this smaller business mentality can't be applied to departments in a larger company.
