description: In an effort to make big technology topics more accessible our managing partner did a talk on machine learning classification models, an introduction to what machine learning is. This is a summary of the talk and link to machine learning information resources.

Machine learning, machine intelligence...machines taking over the world…okay perhaps that last one is stretching it. But we sure have been hearing more and more about machine learning and are seemingly getting farther and farther away from a general understanding of what it actually is.  In an attempt to demystify (we love that word here at FI) the topic of machine learning our managing partner Josh Borts did a talk last month on An [Introduction to Machine Learning Classifiers](https://www.meetup.com/Devhub/events/233471401/) as part of our monthly Lunch and Learn series that we run out of [Devhub](http://devhub.ca) here in Toronto.

His goal in doing this talk was to help professionals, who won’t likely be coding machine learning algorithms, to understand them a bit better; to make this a tangible goal for one talk he focused explicitly on introducing classifier models. For example, we also advertised this event in our [Law and Technology Group](https://www.meetup.com/Toronto-Law-Technology-Meetup/) as legal professionals can greatly benefit from an understanding of these new technologies given the wave of these types of disruptions in that space.

Here’s the slide set for those who couldn’t attend:

It was a pretty big hit! Those who attended came away intellectually stimulated and less overwhelmed by the topic. 

In summary, all this talk about machine learning really isn’t an implication of machines taking over our minds and the world (not to say it won’t be there 50 years from now), but more so an indication that we are getting to a really exciting place in the development of AI technologies in a pragmatically relevant way (more and more professions are benefiting from these advancing technologies). At base machine learning is just data analysis at an incredibly proficient level done by robots, where vastly accurate predictions can be made from the resultant statistical information.  The team over at R2D3 has developed an awe striking [Visual Introduction to Machine Learning[(http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/), where you can glean a better understanding of how it works.
