## Header 2

You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

### Header 3

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}

CONSTANT = {
  this: 'that',
  that: 245,
  there: :weird
}

def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
return CONSTANT
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
