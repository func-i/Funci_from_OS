## Follow Up | Demystifying Shaders

I recently gave a small talk on how to start writing your own vertex and fragment
shaders for WebGL.

Shaders are the programmable parts of our graphics pipeline, and enable us to specify
exactly how our meshes (collections of vertices and other information) appear to
the user on the screen. Learning them is an essential part of working with modern
real time graphics.

Hopefully we provided you with enough information to get over the initial, intimidating
steps involved in writing custom GLSL shaders. 

The code relevant to the talk can be found in this [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/BruOp/shader_presentation). 
You can use the commit history to follow along the same steps used during the presentation.

You can access the slides
[here](http://www.slideshare.net/BrunoOpsenica/demystifying-shaders).
