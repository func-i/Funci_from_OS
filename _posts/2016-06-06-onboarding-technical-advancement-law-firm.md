Legal technology has turned into #LegalTech… yes, it has its own hashtag.  Whenever a hashtag is involved in something industry specific, and you’re a professional in that industry, you can bet that it is something you should know about.  Of course, “LegalTech” is self explanatory - it simply identifies technical advancements in the legal sphere. 

But, are that many firms really on the #LegalTech train? Or is it simply remaining something fun to talk about when you’re wanting to sound forward thinking and relevant? 

Studies indicate that actually comparatively to 2015 - this year shows a fair increase in both adoption and widespread acceptance of technical advancements; for example, an [Am Law-LTN tech survey states] that “...62% of firms have invested in SaaS-based services for e-discovery and/or litigation support”. However, in-spite of the lessening fears of technical advancement, many legal professionals and firms alike are either struggling with or simply avoiding these opportunities to increase the proficiency of their practice.

# Why Technology Adoption is Worth it

The closing paragraph of an article titled “Disruptive technologies: A Canadian lawyer’s perspective on the evolution of law-practice technology” highlights quite a few solid reasons why allowing technological advancement is worth it for a firm and legal professionals:

>“...we’re rapidly moving from a paper-based information management profession to a digitized and rapidly accessible data governance model thereby enabling us to access critical information on demand while at the same time also facilitating the way we carry on our day-to-day practice.” - [Article]

Pulling out a few points in specific: 

- Removing the need for paper and as a result bettering information management 
- Accessibility of information and data and,
- Better data management 

In addition, firms are benefiting in several other ways:
 
- Gaining a competitive edge
- Reducing the cost of overhead and support staff and,
- Facilitating efficient communication with partners and clients 

# Why aren’t all firms jumping onboard the tech forward train? 

In spite of the ongoing advancement of forward thinking firms, many still have concerns and issues with the adoption of new technologies; for example, there are still several barriers to the adoption of the cloud, as the following three points from the Am Law-LTN tech survey indicate: 

- 86% of respondents say there are still major security concerns;
- 61% worry about control and ownership of the data;
- 35% said the cost savings of adoption aren’t high enough

In addition, there are [several other concerns] that are a bit more generalized to all advancements: 

- Basic technophobia - not all lawyers want to be part of firm wide changes
- Multiplicity of devices and cyber security concerns  
- Lack of Internal software compatibilities and,
- Lack of expertise and know how

...to name just a few.

# Don’t Fall into a Status Quo Rut

One of the most widely claimed reasons or “excuses” for the lack of technical advancement in law firms, is simply something that is common across nearly every sector - people (and firms) are generally just set in their ways, and if something isn’t overtly broken or very clearly identified as inhibiting growth or productivity, then why go through the hassle? 

The largest problem with that way of thinking, as [an article in Law Technology Today] suggests, is that law practitioners and their firms end up falling into a status quo rut and settle with maintaining an outdated practice, which is of course bad...practice.

Your firm is going to be stuck in the dino age before we reach 2017, things are moving quicker every day and your firm cannot afford to miss out on the benefits of being tech forward.

# How to Avoid the Status Quo

At FI we have a particular methodology for onboarding and completing all projects, which can be summed up very simply as the following:

- Targeted Assessment
- Strategic Planning
- Open Execution

… and lastly, 

- Continuous Evolution

Your firm can avoid falling into the status quo rut by adopting a similar process to the onboarding of new technologies in your firm.  Quite simply, here’s a basic blueprint with some suggested specifics to help you succeed in jumping on the progressive #LegalTech train: 

### **Targeted Assessment** 

When first deciding whether or not your firm can benefit from a particular software integration, app, or other tool, run a firm wide survey to determine what everyone’s individual problem points are with regard to what you’re thinking of changing or upgrading.  If problem points align, and the technology you’re considering addresses these problems, then you’re targeting an area that can really benefit from a new solution.  In addition, when the time comes to actually use the advancements that have been implemented - there is guaranteed to be a wider acceptance rate across your firm. 

### **Strategic Planning** 

You can plan forever when it comes to how you’re going to implement a new tool, software, or otherwise, but often time a lot of that planning will end up going to waste without ever having gotten to the crux of the matter.  

When planning to onboard a new technology - or anything for that matter - your firm needs to be strategic in its approach. 

#### **Determine your goals:** what specifically does your firm want to accomplish from these changes? For example, a reduction in case review time or making client communication more efficient, thereby reducing client costs.  

#### **Set concrete milestones:** take a step back and map out what it will look like for your firm to be fully on board and making the best use of the advancements. Then, determine what each step is to get there. 

#### **Outline your available and needed resources:** there are numerous resources that could be involved in getting your firm on board with something new - time and money being the obvious ones. But, depending on what it is that you’re installing or integrating with current systems, there could be several other resources needed, like a modulated training program or internal capability growth. 

### **Open Execution** 

When you’re at the stage of actually moving your firm forward with the new installments, maintain an open dialogue with all parties involved. If that’s the entirety of the firm, right through to your paralegals, have regular firm wide meetings updating everyone on installment expectations, how each is expected to engage or be involved etc.  Don’t just surprise everyone one day and expect eager participation and enthusiasm, as you’ll likely meet with the exact opposite. 

### **Continuous Evolution**

It’s important to recognize that the process won’t be flawless and often time pain points and even goals can change before a project is even completed.  Be flexible in your adoption and allow your firm to continually evolve by allowing for frequent iterations, upgrades, team training and recap, as well as full sweep new technology integrations. The ways in which a firm can improve its processes and maximize systems are always growing, don’t be afraid to embrace these changes and allow your firm to evolve along with them.
