How on earth does a company or solo entrepreneur find a good developer? For some reason, there’s something about programming and hiring programmers that freak non-tech people out. Perhaps it’s the mystique of it all?

Afterall, to the non-dev, programming just looks like someone sitting at a computer typing a bunch of alien symbols then doing a bunch of alien things and BAM, somehow we end up with a human relevant app or other piece of software. The fear surrounding finding a good developer seems to be akin to finding a good magician, if being a good magician means having the ability to do magic and x person can do a magical trick, then they can do magic and are a good magician - right?  Similarly, if the developer can do things in this alien language and make human things happen, then it seems they’re a good developer. 

But, here’s the catch - you don’t exactly want to pay someone and then wait until the project is done to find out that actually they weren’t a magician after all and the only trick they’re good at is making your money disappear....womp...womp...womp :(.

**So how do you find a good developer to join your team?**

Well, first define what “good” means to you. Yeah, of course they need to know how to program and in a way that is going to result in the fulfillment of your development needs - but, what does that really look like *for you*? 

Is your need stylistic? For example, if you need someone who can make your app look pretty - well, then you’re looking for a front-end developer with design experience. If on the other hand you’re looking for something like data management and visibility, well then you’re looking for a developer that knows server side languages like Ruby or Python.  

Do some research and dig deeper into what exactly a good programmer is to you.  Once you know exactly what you’re looking for in a programmer, then you’re ready to jump into the hunt! But, where to start? 

Here’s 5 solid tips on how to find a good (really good) developer:

## 1. Tap into the Dev Community

There are tons of doors into the developer community within your locality. Here in Toronto for example we have a [flourishing tech](https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/12/toronto-is-poised-to-become-the-next-great-producer-of-tech-startups/) community that has a ton of niche meetup groups, with [programming book clubs to data literacy groups](http://www.meetup.com/find/?allMeetups=false&keywords=programming&radius=5&userFreeform=Toronto%2C+ON&mcId=z2818654&mcName=Toronto%2C+Ontario%2C+CA&sort=recommended&eventFilter=mysugg) and access to larger developer communities like [Devhub](http://www.meetup.com/Devhub/). Reach out to community organizers before attending and let them know your interest, they’re bound to be able to connect you with some incredible people. 

## 2. Contact Code Schools

Coding bootcamps, like Lighthouse Labs or HackerYou, are great sources for getting first hand pick to some of the best blossoming programmers out there! For example, Lighthouse offers [employer to developer speed date sessions](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/employers) and meet and greets where employers can meet with and interview developers of all levels. 

## 3. Devshops that Offer on Project Training 

Forgive me, I’m going to do a bit of “look at how awesome our company is” promoing here - but, with good reason.

Some software consultancy firms (eg. us) offer on project training and recruitment. What does this mean? It means that they’ll find and take on a developer for the duration of your project, train them specifically for the needs of your project and then hand them off to you as your own in-house developer. Not to “toot our own horn”, but this truly is a unique and awesome way of finding a developer that has been tried and tested for exactly what you need. 

## 4. Ask Good Devs! 

It seems so obvious, but is so vastly neglected as a method of finding solid developers to join your team. Reaching out to other developers you know that are doing awesome things in other companies already and asking them if they know other developers that do what you need, is probably the easiest route to success. Most developers (who are good developers) are actively involved in their communities and know a TON of others doing exactly what they’re doing and doing a heck of a good job at it. 

## 5. Research Online Developer Communities

This is probably the most tedious of suggestions, but it could have you happily engaged with your future programmer after some steady forum prowling. There are very active...sorry, allow me to rephrase that...very, very, very active programming communities online. In these communities many people have profiles where you can check out their previous work and portfolios. In addition, you can often find out where these developers are based and if not within your geographical reach, well, many of them (if looking for work) are very likely interested in working remotely (not as crazy as it might sound anymore).  

Well, I hope this has helped all of you non-devs desperately in search of your very own and well experienced developer.
