# Pomodoro Technique

Over the last 18 months I have been using the Pomodoro technique.  It all started by hearing of the basic premies at a meetup event.

The idea is simple, you write down a task you would like to accomplish and do 25 minutes of work.
You then rest for 5 minutes, this is called a "pomodoro".
Once you complete one pomodoro, you do it over again. After 4 pomodoros you take a longer 15 minute break.

The name came from those little kitchen timers shaped like tomatoes, in fact pomodoro means tomato in Italian.

There is no need for any special software or tools. You can use a physical watch timer and pen & paper if you wanted to. I like using [Evernote](http://evernote.com) and [PomodoroOne app (Mac)](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/pomodoro-one/id907364780?mt=12).

I follow the same process with two modifications, I mark a task as successful or failed and I archive pomodoro tasks at the end of the day.

## Example

**Pomodoro**

* \#1 Finish slides for presentation. **Success**
* \#2 Do presentation. **Success**
* \#3 Write blog post about Pomodoro technique. **Failed (distracted by conversation with boss)**
* \#4 Finish writing blog post **Success**
* \#5 Research different intro/tour plugins.

**Archive**

August 4, 2015

* \#1 Finish styling the menu. **FAILED need more time**
* \#2 more styling. **Success**
* \#3 Refactor menu so content can be replaced. **Success**
* \#4 Commit intermediate step and proceed to make help menu work. **FAILED**
* \#5 Finish the help menu work. **Success**

## Advantages

Using this technique I found the following advantages:

* Stay focused on the one task
* Reduce interactions
* Estimate tasks better
* Get better idea of how long things take
* Ability to revaluate tactics
* Less tired at the end of the day!
* Faster context switching
* This is how we do things outside of work: school, gym, etc
* Tackle “scary” or boring tasks
* Find creative solution to a problem

## Beyond Pomodoro

Beyond the normal pomodoro I usually have headers for `Today`, `Tomorrow`, `Later` to keep track of other tasks. 
Sometimes I would just use a tool like Trello, ZenHub, etc to communicate those things to co-workers instead.

Go out there and try it. Let us know what your thoughts are.
