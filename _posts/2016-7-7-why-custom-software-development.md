So, you’re looking toward software development as the solution for your business to address a particular issue, perhaps with client processing, data management or otherwise.  If you’ve already narrowed it down to looking for a software firm in Canada, then you’re well situated.  Canada is actually ranked [first out of 9 developed countries](http://international.gc.ca/investors-investisseurs/sector-secteurs/software-logiciel.aspx?lang=eng) for the source of software development services, with a whopping 12.9% cost advantage over the United States, this includes both the development of packaged software and custom development for unique business solutions.

So, alright, you have it narrowed down to Canada as a good place to look for your software solution (and for good reason) - but, what approach is best for solving your business problem - packaged or custom?   

On the one hand we have tried and tested packaged software to solve a plethora of common business problems. On the other hand we have the option to approach a consultative software firm to develop a custom software solution. Each can be right for their own reasons. 

# **Packaged Product Software**

|---|---|
| Limited budget  |   Rigidness  |    
|  Lacking in-house resources |             Won't meet unique needs    |   
|   Technology wouldn't enhance competive edge |      Compatibility Issues         |

## **Why businesses turn to packaged products**

Packaged software plays the largest role in terms of GDP contributions in Canada per industry segment, and that isn’t for the wrong reasons.  Huge software players have identified niche and specific problems and have developed hyper specialized software to offer targeted solutions for these problems.  Many businesses have the same problems - for example, managing projects from ideation and budgeting through to completion - and there are several out of the box project management solutions to help with these common business processes.  Often these universal problems have SaaS cloud based tools that offer solutions on the cheap; for example, [trello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trello) - a widely used project management platform (even we use it!).   

There are several other perfectly good reasons to turn to packaged software over custom build, for example: 

**Limited Budget:** 

Often because packaged software solutions are spread across a large user market, their cost is much cheaper. They’re a one-size-fits-all framework and since it can be built once and then licensed out over and over again on an unlimited basis (market permitting), it can generally be offered much cheaper. Although, as is true of one-size-fits-all clothing, it often ends up not fitting well and depending on the occasion a well-tailored suit might be better.

**Lacking in-house technology resources:** 

If you don’t have an internal technical innovation team, complete with software developers that offer custom software fixes, then you may have a technical deficiency on your team.  Often, with some training, packaged solutions can provide a user friendly answer to your business problem.

**Technology wouldn’t enhance your competitive edge:**  

If you work in a company or industry that isn’t particularly “tech forward”, then investing in custom built software may not give you an ROI worth caring about. For example, a coffee shop that is trying to make its customer payment processing more efficient would likely do just fine with an out of the box solution already built and ready to fly for small businesses; investing in a custom built solution that has a few extra features, simply wouldn’t make sense. 

## **Why packaged software products fall short**

To get the high quality and full spectrum answers that you’re looking for to solve your business solutions - you’re going to have to look elsewhere beyond hyper specialized packaged solutions.  

**Off the shelf solutions can be rigid:** 

If there’s something unique to the way your company manages a process, or you want to incorporate a fresh idea into your business infrastructure, you’re likely going to be sorely disappointed when trying to make an out of the box solution work - it simply won’t.  Packaged software products are designed to solve universal and extremely exact business problems. 

**Won’t meet your unique needs:** 

Packaged software is designed to address a generalized problem.  This software doesn’t always have all the features you need, and invariably has many that you don't want.  So, while there’s cost saved on one end, you can also end up paying for something excess that doesn’t address your needs, which in the long-run could end up costing you even more or require you to change your business processes to match the software.   

**Program and language compatibility:** 

Integrating a custom software might be at odds with your internal capabilities making it very difficult or even near impossible to work with a particular software, or being cause for resource intensive compatibility solutions. More established companies likely already have established technical infrastructures, with particular programs and languages set up along with the in-house “know how”, all of which could be at odds with an out of the box solution.  

# **Why custom software development can be the better choice**

If any of the above listed reasons resonates with you as to why a packaged solution might not work out for your business, then read on and learn how custom software development could be the right alternative.

**Competitive advantage:**

Many companies across several sectors are feeling the heat with regard to technical innovation waves, and the demand for technical adaptation is only growing. For most companies business growth through technical innovation is a must in order to remain competitive. This doesn’t necessarily mean building entirely new apps or products either, it could be something as simple as better utilizing your data or improving client servicing. 

For example, we’re currently building a client processing tool for a law firm that will help them process new clients more efficiently, allowing them to move away from the billable hour model for at least one component of their work. This tool will enable the firm to onboard clients and cater to this clientele better, thereby putting them above competing firms. 

**Productivity & Efficiency:** 

Rather than hacking around the limitations of an out of the box product, wasting resources, or changing internal processes - a custom solution can offer a tailored platform that aligns directly with your company's needs. Working directly with developers during the build process for your solution can ensure that your specific needs are addressed and will thereby increase productivity wholistically due to solution efficiency. 

One way to visualize this benefit is by imagining what a software would function like if you were able to provide your unique input the entire way through the software development life cycle (SDLC).

**Long-term Flexibility:**

Having an in-house programming team or software development partner creates an environment for continuous business growth. For startups, or new products, this can be a particularly beneficial approach given that a project can launch with the core functionality and evolve over time. 

**Shelf-life:**

With custom software you don’t have to worry about ongoing updates, service fees, licensing costs or even product obsolescence - all of which could end up resulting in massive long term costs. When your business decides to go with custom development, through hiring a solid development team or outsourcing to a software consultancy firm, your business owns the software. This ownership aspect alone does away with all of the ongoing associated costs with SaaS or licensed software. 

Ultimately, what it comes down to is what’s right for your company. If you can relate to the problems listed above with out of the box software, well then you ought to at least consult with a custom build firm or inquire with trusted IT professionals in your network. Doing these things will help you see if your needs might be better met in the long-run by a bespoke alternative.
