## Follow Up | Owning Your Front-end Performance

My colleague Laith and I recently presented to a healthy crowd at [Devhub](http://devhub.ca)'s [Devmonth](http://devhub.ca/devmonth) about front-end performance.

In our day-to-day work as full-stack devs here at FI, we kept bumping up against front-end performance bottlenecks we couldn't tackle using easy, one-liner, talking point, black and white Rules™. We realized improving front-end performance requires a much deeper understanding of how browsers really work—how we go from an HTML response to pixels on a screen.

Hopefully we provided some tools you can use to start owning your front-end performance.

Here are the [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/func_i/own-your-frontend-performance-tools-not-rules-61049480).
