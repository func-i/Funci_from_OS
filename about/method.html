        Often ideas sprout and are put to action before a real goal is ever
        defined.  Without goal definition a lot of valuable resources can be
        lost before ever moving beyond the planning stage of a project. 
      </p>

        Through targeted assessment FI helps you start off on the right foot
        and prepare for a well defined scope that moves beyond prehistoric
        planning methodologies.

        It goes without saying that a project needs to go through a rigorous
        planning phase, but planning does not mean simply putting together
        the pieces and resources and then moving forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        Strategy in the planning phase is a mandatory element to the 
        successful execution of any project.  Understanding a project fully
        from all angles and how it works toward the fulfillment of your
        goals is the key to moving your project beyond the likelihood of
        extinction.
