            Often ideas sprout and are put to action before a real goal is ever
            defined.  Without goal definition a lot of valuable resources can be
            lost before ever moving beyond the planning stage of a project. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Through targeted assessment FI helps you start off on the right foot
            and prepare for a well defined scope that moves beyond prehistoric
            planning methodologies.

              It goes without saying that a project needs to go through a rigorous
              planning phase, but planning does not mean simply putting together
              the pieces and resources and then moving forward.
            </p>
            <p>
              Strategy in the planning phase is a mandatory element to the 
              successful execution of any project.  Understanding a project fully
              from all angles and how it works toward the fulfillment of your
              goals is the key to moving your project beyond the likelihood of
              extinction.

            We believe keeping a fluid discussion with our clients for the duration
            of a project is not only important, but mandatory for successful
            completion. Through the use of full-stack software technologies and an
            open dialogue the Functional Imperative team engineers adaptive software
            making your business relevant to the new web.

        <h1>Continuous Evolution</h1>
        <p>
          We believe people and software should always be growing through progressive
          adaptation and this doesn’t stop at the completion of a project.  Our
          methodology is designed to ensure things are done right each step of
          the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, it doesn’t stop there - technical adaptation through repeated
          iterations is the key to survival.  A project can always be made better
          and kinks are inevitable.  Our process is designed to allow for an early
          launch while maintaining effective risk management and continuous improvement.
