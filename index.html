            It goes without saying that a project needs to go through a rigorous
            planning phase, but planning does not mean simply putting together
            the pieces and resources and then moving forward.
          </p>
          <p>
            Strategy in the planning phase is a mandatory element to the 
            successful execution of any project.  Understanding a project fully
            from all angles and how it works toward the fulfillment of your
            goals is the key to moving your project beyond the likelihood of
            extinction.

            We believe keeping a fluid discussion with our clients for the duration
            of a project is not only important, but mandatory for successful
            completion. Through the use of full-stack software technologies and an
            open dialogue the Functional Imperative team engineers adaptive software
            making your business relevant to the new web.
